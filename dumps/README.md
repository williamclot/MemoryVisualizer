# A few dumps that we used...

We downloaded a few dumps that worked very well with our program. We uploaded a zipped file with a few of these memory dumps that you could download if you want at the following address:
- [http://demo.williamclot.com/files/windows_dumps.zip](http://demo.williamclot.com/files/windows_dumps.zip)

You can either execute:

```bash
$ wget http://demo.williamclot.com/files/windows_dumps.zip
```

Or just execute the script in this folder:
```bash
$ ./get_dumps.sh
```
